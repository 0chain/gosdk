The 0chain client SDK is written in GO.
This repository currently supports the following platforms:
- OSX Mojave 10.14.5
- LINUX (Ubuntu/bionic).
  - This includes all Ubuntu 18+ platforms, so Ubuntu 19, Linux Mint 19 etc. (apt based package installer)
- LINUX (RHEL/CENTOS 7+)
  - All Releases based on RHEL 7+, Centos 7+, Fedora 30 etc. (yum based package installer)

It is possible to support the sdk for other variations of Linux as well.

## Usage
- Save below code as sdkversion.go

        package main

        import (
            "fmt"

            "github.com/0chain/gosdk/zcncore"
        )

        func main() {
            fmt.Println("gosdk version: ", zcncore.GetVersion())
        }

- Run below command: (if you don't have gosdk already in your GOPATH)

        go get github.com/0chain/gosdk
- Build the sample application sdkversion

        go build -o sdkversion sdkversion.go
- Run the executable

        ./sdkversion
- If it prints the gosdk version installed then setup is complete.
