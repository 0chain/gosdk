# 0chain/gosdk
The 0chain client SDK is written in Go programming language.
This repository currently supports the following platforms:
- OSX Mojave 10.14.5
- LINUX (Ubuntu/bionic).
  - This includes all Ubuntu 18+ platforms, so Ubuntu 19, Linux Mint 19 etc. (apt based package installer)
- LINUX (RHEL/CENTOS 7+)
  - All Releases based on RHEL 7+, Centos 7+, Fedora 30 etc. (yum based package installer)

It is possible to support the sdk for other variations of Linux as well.

## Usage
- Save below code as sdkversion.go

        package main

        import (
            "fmt"

            "github.com/0chain/gosdk/zcncore"
        )

        func main() {
            fmt.Println("gosdk version: ", zcncore.GetVersion())
        }

- Run below command: (if you don't have gosdk already in your GOPATH)

        go get github.com/0chain/gosdk
- Build the sample application sdkversion

        go build -o sdkversion sdkversion.go
- Run the executable

        ./sdkversion
- If it prints the gosdk version installed then setup is complete.


## Mobile Builds (iOS and Android) ##
- gosdk can be build to use on Mobile platforms iOS and Android using gomobile.
- Xcode Command Line Tools is required to build SDK for iOS.
- Android studio with NDK is required to build SDK for Android
- Run below command for the first time to setup gomobile environment

        make setup-gomobile

- Use below commands in the root folder of the repo to build Mobile SDK

        For iOS and Android:
                make build-mobilesdk IOS=1 ANDROID=1
        For iOS only:
                make build-mobilesdk IOS=1
        For Android only:
                make build-mobilesdk ANDROID=1

## How to export a gosdk function to WebAssembly ##

Examples:
* `wasmsdk/ethwallet.go` which exports the functions in `zcncore/ethwallet.go`.
* `wasmsdk/wallet.go` which exports one function in `zcncore/wallet.go`.

Steps:

1. If you are exporting:
  
    - a new function from `zcncore/wallet.go`, you should add to `wasmsdk/wallet.go`
  
    - a function from a new file, you should create a new `<filename>.go` file for it, in the same style as `wasmsdk/wallet.go` or `wasmsdk/ethwallet.go`

2. In func main(), `https://github.com/0chain/gosdk/wasmsdk/proxy.go`, you need to add this line:

    ```golang
        js.Global().Set("YOURFUNC", js.FuncOf(YOURFUNC))
    ```

3. Now you need to compile a new `<any_name>.wasm` (e.g. proxy.wasm). Currently, the right version to compile wasm is with Go version 1.16. So make sure you have it to make the wasm build works properly. In order to compile, run the following command: 

    ```bash
    $ GOOS=js CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=wasm go build -o <any_name>.wasm github.com/0chain/gosdk/wasmsdk
    ```

### An important note regarding export of a async function

If your golang function requires to be run asynchronously, you need to add more wrapper code where you are returning a Promise object.

See "InitZCNSDK" example:

```golang
func InitZCNSDK(this js.Value, p []js.Value) interface{} {
	blockWorker := p[0].String()
	signscheme := p[1].String()

	handler := js.FuncOf(func(this js.Value, args []js.Value) interface{} {
		resolve := args[0]
		// reject := args[1]

		go func() {
			err := zcncore.InitZCNSDK(blockWorker, signscheme)
			if err != nil {
				fmt.Println("error:", err)
			}
			resolve.Invoke()
		}()

		return nil
	})

	// Create and return the Promise object
	promiseConstructor := js.Global().Get("Promise")
	return promiseConstructor.New(handler)
}
```

## How to run unit test ##

### BLS unit test

It's advisable to put GOPATH as $TOP/../go, to avoid conflicts with this command: `go build ./...`

To run all the unit tests in `gosdk`: go test github.com/0chain/gosdk/zboxcore/sdk -v`
```bash
$ go test ./...
```

To run all the unit tests in `bls0chain_test.go`, run this command from $TOP: `go test github.com/0chain/gosdk/core/zcncrypto -v`

To run a specific unit test in `bls0chain_test.go` such as `TestSignatureScheme`, run this: `go test github.com/0chain/gosdk/core/zcncrypto -v -run TestSignatureScheme`

To run the coverage test in `gosdk:
```bash
$ go test <path_to_folder> -coverprofile=coverage.out
$ go tool cover -html=coverage.out
```

### WebAssembly

#### Using go test

1. You need to install nodejs first, see [this page](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) for further instructions

2. Add `/path/to/go/misc/wasm` to your `$PATH` environment variable (so that "go test" can find "go_js_wasm_exec"). For example in ubuntu, run `$export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/misc/wasm/`.

3. You can then run the test by following the [BLS unit test](#bls-unit-test) above with adding the prefix environment `GOOS=js CGO_ENABLED=0 GOARCH=wasm`:
    ```
    go test -tags test -v github.com/0chain/gosdk/wasmsdk
    ```

#### Test in the client 

1. After you successfully [export the wasm package to proxy.wasm](#how-to-export-a-gosdk-function-to-webassembly), now you can test that `proxy.wasm`. 

2. We currently have a test page going at the js-client-sdk repo: `https://github.com/0chain/js-client-sdk/blob/gosdk/test/index.html`

3. You can replace the proxy.wasm at `https://github.com/0chain/js-client-sdk/blob/gosdk/test/proxy.wasm`

4. You need to startup a special test server in order to stream WASM files. Use this command from js-client-sdk $TOP: `sudo php -S localhost:82 test/server.php`

5. See "testethwallet" function in index.html for how the testing for ethwallet.go is done

6. To test the function you exported, it's probably as simple as calling "HelloWorld()". It should be a 1-liner.
